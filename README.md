# Cuckoo-Search-Alogrithm
This project presented the diagnostic evaluation of the effects of search population and the number of iterations in solving the benchmark functions and Levy functions using the CS. After a number of experimental procedures, it was discovered that in solving the benchmark function as well as the Levy function, the CS obtained better results when a population of 20 nests was deployed to the search space. By using 20 nests, near-optimal solutions were obtainable from as low as 100 to 200 iterations. In fact, at 100 iterations,5 dimensions and +1/-1 lower bound the CS obtained the best result in every run. Surprisingly, however, this study discovered that increasing the iteration, dimension and lower and upper bound did not improve the solution. It rather worsened the result and increased the processing time. Similarly, for the Levy function, the near-optimal solution was obtainable at 100 iterations and with a search population of 20 nests. The use of more iterations-cum-nests was discovered to only increase the processing overhead without the expected improvement in results
